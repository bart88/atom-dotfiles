# atom-dotfiles
Complete backup of my atom settings and packages. 

To use simply copy over or ```rm -rf ~/.atom/``` existing atom directory. This will remove all your settings. 
Other wise clone this repo into a temp directory and copy the projects .git file over. Then ``` git pull ``` the remote master and merge anything.
