I wanted to make these available for Atom users.\n\n## Snippets\n\nThis library has many of the snippets in [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets), but not all of them. It does not include snippets for:\n\n* `React.DOM` API, since it assumes people will be using JSX.\n* ES5-style `React.createClass({...})` style of defining Component classes, assuming people will be using ES6 class syntax.\n\nIt also differs stylistically from the original versions:\n* Adheres to Airbnb style guide.\n* Use tabs instead of spaces to accommodate different tab-widths.\n* Descriptions are edited to read better in atom-autocomplete tooltips.\n\n## Future plans\nIn future versions, I would like to add snippets for Redux and ES7 syntax.\n",
