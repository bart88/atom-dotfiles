# Egghead React Snippets

## About
This is a port of Joe Maddalone's comprehensive snippets collection [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets), made with the help of [_atomizr_](https://github.com/idleberg/atomizr).

If you've seen Joe's videos on [Egghead](https://egghead.io), you've probably seen him use these snippets in Sublime Text. I wanted to make these available for Atom users.

## Snippets

This library has many of the snippets in [ReactSublimeSnippets](https://github.com/joemaddalone/ReactSublimeSnippets), but not all of them. It does not include snippets for:

* `React.DOM` API, since it assumes people will be using JSX.
* ES5-style `React.createClass({...})` style of defining Component classes, assuming people will be using ES6 class syntax.

It also differs stylistically from the original versions:
* Adheres to Airbnb style guide.
* Use tabs instead of spaces to accommodate different tab-widths.
* Descriptions are edited to read better in atom-autocomplete tooltips.

## Future plans
In future versions, I would like to add snippets for Redux and ES7 syntax.
